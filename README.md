## Technologies used

### Tailwind css
Tailwind is a CSS framework that make styling a frontend app simple with its reusable classes.
Tailwind uses different concept of spacing as it uses multiples of 4 (with some exception).
Tailwind has its own color palette and it can be customized from its configuration file.
In this project I made my own color palette that inherits from the main tailwind palette (you can see the palette if you uncomment the first section of index.html).
Tailwind support dark theme by adding "dark:" prefix before the classes that you want tailwind apply when darkmode is on.

### JQuery
JQuery is a JS library that simplify Javascript.
I used JQuery here to be able to use JQuery plugin called "Slick slider"

AOS is JS library to make animations on scroll by just add attributes to elements that I want to animate on scroll.
